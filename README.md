# screepsGan

I dive into styleGan architecture and later try to do something cool for screeps community

Plan goes as follows:
- try out some basic GAN on easy dataset
- parse screeps top 200 rooms
- try to generate them
- get hands on V100 (how?)
- try styleGAN on easy dataset
- try styleGAN on cool dataset
- embedding room into styleGAN styles
- getnerate cool room based on existing ones

Every GAN will be realised by pytorch methods(rather then find existsing solutions) for learning purposes

Well time to start reading some whitepapers
